## about
Currentcy automatically converts foreign prices to the defined local currency (this value can be set in the options menu and defaults to Euro)

Currently, the supported currencies are EUR, USD, CAD, GBP, INR, JPY and CNY.

## data source
All data is being fetched from the free API at https://free.currencyconverterapi.com, which updates every 30 minutes.
Once the local data for a rate is older than 30 minutes, it will be updated.
